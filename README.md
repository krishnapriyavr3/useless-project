### Project Description
ObjectTalk is a quirky, full-featured social media platform built specifically for inanimate objects. From lamps that gossip to chairs with existential crises, this is the platform no one asked for‚Äîbut somehow, everyone loves.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Inanimate objects have no voice or platform to express their bottled-up feelings or daily struggles. Day after day, they silently witness our chaos... but what if they could speak?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a social network where objects can post updates, chat with each other, and react‚Äîbecause chairs need to vent, toasters need attention, and mirrors have serious self-reflection issues.
